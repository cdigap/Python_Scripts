# Python_Scripts
Lab Scripts

## Week 1 and 2 exercises 
In a single file [Fib_Surname.py](Fib_Surname.py)

## Week 3 exercise 
In file [Collatz_conjecture.py](Collatz_conjecture.py)

## Exercise 4 -  
Problem 5 from *Project Euler.* is file (SML_MLT.py](SML_MLT.py)

Problem 5 from *Project Euler with time taken* is [SML_MLT_TIME.py[(SML_MLT_TIME.py)

Excercise 5 - Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. That is, on the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns. File is Iris_in_Format.py


Excercise 6 - Write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 which equals 120. You should, in your script, test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10. File is Factorial.py

Added another file which looks for an input from the user and gives the factorial of that number. File is Factorial_Inp.py.
