Lab Scripts

Week 1 and 2 exercises are in a single file Fib_Surname.py

Week 3 exercise is in file Collatz_conjecture.py

Exercise 4 -  problem 5 from Project Euler. is file SML_MLT.py

              problem 5 from Project Euler with time taken is SML_MLT_TIME.py

Excercise 5 - Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. That is, on the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns. File is Iris_in_Format.py


Excercise 6 - Write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 which equals 120. You should, in your script, test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10. File is Factorial.py
